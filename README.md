# SMTP Web3 Gateway
Welcome to the SMTP Web3 Gateway repository! This innovative server bridges the gap between traditional email services (Web2) and the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. As a pivotal component of the Decentralized Mail Finance Infrastructure, our gateway facilitates seamless integration of standard email communications into the blockchain space.

## Overview
The SMTP Web3 Gateway is designed to receive emails from the Web2 environment, encode these messages, and then post them to their respective smart contracts on the blockchain. This integration enables a groundbreaking approach to decentralized email services, allowing for secure, verifiable, and immutable communication stored on the blockchain.

## Key Features
1. **Email to Smart Contract Encoding**: Converts traditional email messages into a format that can be directly interacted with via smart contracts.
2. **Spam Reduction Mechanism**: Implements a novel approach to spam reduction by requiring domains to pay a gate pass fee, ensuring only verified and intended emails make their transition into the Web3 realm.
3. **Decentralized Mail Finance Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the broader Decentralized Mail Finance Infrastructure, enhancing the utility and capabilities of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms through secure and verified email communications.

## Getting Started
To get started with the SMTP Web3 Gateway, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository

```bash

```
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. Then, run:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
3. Run the Gateway

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Usage

After setting up the SMTP Web3 Gateway, your system will start receiving emails from specified domains, encode them, and post them to the configured smart contracts on the blockchain.

To utilize this gateway within your decentralized application (DApp), refer to the docs directory for detailed API documentation and integration guides.
